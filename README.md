# DragonHood

Dragonhood is a Mobile Game with
Augmented Reality aspects, set in the real world neighbourhood
of players. The real aspects are enhanced with
fictional scenarios players have to cooperatively solve to
win the game.

Dragonhood is split up into two Modes: The Creation Mode allows players to split
up each scenario marker into multiple pieces and set the
GPS-position for each of them. To choose GPS-positions
they need to move to a location in the real world, select a
scenario type and confirm the position selection. Once all
marker pieces are set, the information can be saved to file.

The Play Mode allows users to load save-files
created during Creation Mode and share the scenario positions
with other players over the network. Scenario positions
can then be viewed on an Augmented Reality map,
which is displayed when scanning the corresponding marker. 

There are two different scenarios: A puzzle box, which has to be solved cooperatively by the players and a dragon, which has to be defeated cooperatively.
